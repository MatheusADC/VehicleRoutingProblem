This project presents an analysis of a vehicle routing problem where, in the first step, based on the chosen number of points, the x and y coordinates of each point are printed along with an ID. Then, in the second step, an NxN matrix is created in which the distance between the points is printed. Finally, the individuals are displayed in ascending order based on the sum of the distances, along with the points that represent the route.
